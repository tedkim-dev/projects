# Event-Driven Microservices Architecture - Technical Documentation

## Project Overview

**Technologies**: Go, PostgreSQL, Redis, Docker, Kubernetes, Event-Driven Architecture

## Executive Summary

Designed and implemented a production-ready, event-driven microservices architecture for a ticket booking system handling complex multi-step workflows including VIP bundles, transportation coordination, and payment processing. The system serves as a reference implementation of modern distributed systems patterns with comprehensive observability and reliability guarantees.

## Technical Architecture

### Core Design Patterns

#### 1. Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)
- **Event Sourcing**: All state changes stored as immutable events
- **CQRS**: Separated command and query responsibilities for optimal performance
- **Outbox Pattern**: Guaranteed message delivery with database-backed persistence
- **Saga Pattern**: Distributed transaction management for complex workflows

#### 2. Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
- **Bounded Contexts**: Clear domain boundaries (Bookings, Tickets, Payments, Transportation)
- **Aggregates**: Ticket, Booking, VIPBundle as consistency boundaries
- **Domain Events**: Business events like `TicketBookingConfirmed`, `VipBundleFinalized`
- **Value Objects**: Money, UUID, Email for type safety

#### 3. Microservices Communication
- **Event Bus**: Redis-based message broker using Watermill library
- **Command Bus**: Synchronous command processing with event publishing
- **API Gateway**: Centralized routing and authentication
- **Service Discovery**: Dynamic service registration and discovery

### Technology Stack

#### Backend Infrastructure
```go
// Core Technologies
- Go 1.24 (Primary language)
- PostgreSQL 15.2 (Event store & read models)
- Redis 6.2 (Message broker & caching)
- Watermill (Event-driven messaging)
- Echo v4 (HTTP framework)
- SQLx (Database abstraction)
```

#### Observability & Monitoring
```yaml
# Distributed Tracing
- OpenTelemetry (OTEL) for distributed tracing
- Jaeger for trace visualization
- Correlation IDs for request tracking

# Metrics & Monitoring
- Prometheus for metrics collection
- Grafana for dashboards and alerting
- Custom business metrics (bookings, revenue)

# Logging
- Structured logging with correlation IDs
- Log levels and centralized aggregation
```

#### External Integrations
```go
// Third-party Services
- Dead Nation API (External booking system)
- Spreadsheets API (Data export & reporting)
- Files API (Document management)
- Payments Service (Secure payment processing)
- Transportation Service (Flight & transport booking)
```

## Key Technical Achievements

### 1. Reliable Message Delivery
**Challenge**: Ensuring message delivery in distributed system with network failures  
**Solution**: Implemented Outbox Pattern with database persistence
```go
// Outbox Pattern Implementation
type OutboxMessage struct {
    ID        string    `db:"id"`
    Topic     string    `db:"topic"`
    Payload   []byte    `db:"payload"`
    CreatedAt time.Time `db:"created_at"`
    Processed bool      `db:"processed"`
}
```

### 2. Complex Workflow Orchestration
**Challenge**: Managing multi-step VIP bundle bookings with external dependencies  
**Solution**: Implemented Saga Pattern with compensation logic
```go
// VIP Bundle Saga
type VipBundleProcessManager struct {
    commandBus command.Bus
    eventBus   event.Bus
    repository VipBundleRepository
}

// Saga Steps: Initialize → Book Tickets → Book Flight → Finalize
```

**Results**: Successfully handles complex 5+ step workflows with automatic rollback

### 3. Event Sourcing Implementation
**Challenge**: Maintaining audit trail and enabling temporal queries  
**Solution**: Event sourcing with optimized read models
```go
// Event Store
type EventStore interface {
    AppendEvents(aggregateID string, events []Event) error
    GetEvents(aggregateID string) ([]Event, error)
}

// Read Models
type OpsBookingReadModel struct {
    BookingID       uuid.UUID `db:"booking_id"`
    NumberOfTickets int       `db:"number_of_tickets"`
    CustomerEmail   string    `db:"customer_email"`
    ShowID          uuid.UUID `db:"show_id"`
}
```

**Results**: Complete audit trail, temporal queries, and data consistency

### 4. Distributed Tracing & Observability
**Challenge**: Debugging issues across multiple services  
**Solution**: Comprehensive observability stack
```go
// OpenTelemetry Integration
func ConfigureTraceProvider() *tracesdk.TracerProvider {
    return tracesdk.NewTracerProvider(
        tracesdk.WithBatcher(exporter),
        tracesdk.WithResource(resource),
    )
}
```

## Performance & Scalability

### Horizontal Scaling
- **Stateless Services**: All services designed for horizontal scaling
- **Message Partitioning**: Topic-based message routing
- **Load Balancing**: API Gateway with health checks

## Security Implementation

### Authentication & Authorization
- **API Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse

## Testing Strategy
- Unit Tests
- Integration Tests
- Component Tests

<!--

## Lessons Learned & Best Practices

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Event Sourcing**: Excellent for audit trails, but requires careful read model design
2. **CQRS**: Great for performance, but increases complexity
3. **Outbox Pattern**: Essential for reliable messaging in distributed systems
4. **Observability**: Invest early in comprehensive monitoring

### Technical Challenges Overcome
1. **Event Ordering**: Implemented idempotency keys for message deduplication
2. **Concurrent Access**: Used optimistic locking for aggregate consistency
3. **External Dependencies**: Implemented circuit breakers and retry logic
4. **Data Consistency**: Used saga pattern for distributed transactions

### Future Improvements
1. **Event Versioning**: Implement event schema evolution
2. **CQRS Optimization**: Further optimize read model queries
3. **Service Mesh**: Consider Istio for advanced traffic management
4. **Machine Learning**: Add ML-based fraud detection
